# Pacmen
Description:
This repository hosts a web-based PacMan game where various PacMan images traverse the webpage, bouncing off walls upon contact. Initiating the game with the "Start Game" button prompts the PacMen to move at increasing speeds with each activation. Pressing "Add PacMan" dynamically adds a new PacMan image to the game, updating the array that tracks their positions and velocities.

How to run:
To run the game, clone the repository into a single directory, ensuring the image links are valid. Open the index.html file in a web browser and use the "Start Game" and "Add PacMan" buttons as described.
